# ArtAuction
The data is extracted from the website "BID & HAMMER". The dataset on the website has information on 10 artwork auctions and I was able to extract 6 rows of data from it. I was just practicing scrapping data from a website. The data might have some errors and hence, can be used only for practicing.
